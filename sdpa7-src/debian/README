SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm)
High-performance software package for SemiDefinite Programs

Copyright (C) 2004-2013 SDPA Project

"SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm)" is one of the most
efficient and stable software packages for solving SDPs based on the
primal-dual interior-point method.
SDP (SemiDefinite Programs) is used for
financial engineering, machine learning, control theory,
sensor network problem, quantum chemistry, quantum information,
combinatorial optimizaiton, polynomial optimization, and so on.

If you have questions on the installation,
please contact us from
http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/

The user-manual of SDPA is available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdpa/files/sdpa/sdpa.7.1.1.manual.20080618.pdf/download

Note for numerical evaluations:
SDPA debian package is usually linked with openblas-base package.
This openblas-base package might not be optimized for your processor.
To report computation time of SDPA in some article, you should 
install optimized BLAS and compile SDPA from its source code.

SDPA-M:
 The user-manual of SDPA-M is available at
